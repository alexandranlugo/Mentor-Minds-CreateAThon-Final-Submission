# Mentor Minds - Final Submission (Team 9)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the final submission for Team 9: Mentor Minds, presented as part of our group project. The project is divided into several key components:

### 1. **Flashcards and Quiz Code**
   - This folder contains the code and resources related to our flashcards and quiz application, designed to help students reinforce their learning. The contents of the `flashcards.zip` and `quiz.zip` files have been unzipped and included in this directory.

### 2. **Video Demos**
   - The `Video Demos` folder includes demonstrations of our Large Language Model (LLM), AIristotle, in action. These videos showcase various examples of AIristotle guiding students through problem-solving processes without providing direct answers.

### 3. **Path/To (Open WebUI Source Code)**
   - This folder contains the source code for the WebUI, which we utilized as the interface for our LLM. The path leads to the open WebUI source code hosted in another repository, integrated as a submodule in this project.

## AIristotle - The Large Language Model

AIristotle is a customized LLM designed to enhance student learning by encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving. Instead of providing direct answers, AIristotle asks guiding questions to lead students to discover the solutions on their own.

### Backend and Interface
- **Backend:** AIristotle is powered by Ollama, which serves as the backend for processing and managing the model.
- **Interface:** We used WebUI as the interface, allowing users to interact with the model seamlessly.

### Deployment
- The models are downloaded from the source and run locally on a GPU-supported environment to ensure efficient performance and real-time interactions.

## Getting Started

To explore the various components of our project:

1. **Flashcards and Quiz Code:**
   - Navigate to the `Flashcards and Quiz Code` folder to explore the educational tools we've developed.

2. **Video Demos:**
   - View the `Video Demos` folder to see how AIristotle works in different scenarios.

3. **WebUI Source Code:**
   - The `path/to` folder includes the open WebUI source code, providing insight into how we set up the user interface.

## Acknowledgments

- We would like to thank all contributors and the open-source community for providing the tools and resources that made this project possible.
- Special thanks to the creators of Ollama and WebUI for their robust platforms that supported the development of AIristotle.
